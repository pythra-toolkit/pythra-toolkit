## 🚀 Key Features

* **Declarative UI:** Describe your UI as a function of your application's state. When the state changes, PyThra intelligently updates only the necessary parts of the UI.
* **Component-Based:** Build your application by composing small, reusable `Widget`s, just like in modern web frameworks.
* **Python-First:** Write your entire application logic, state management, and UI structure in pure Python. No need to write HTML, CSS, or JavaScript by hand.
* **Efficient Reconciliation:** Features a sophisticated reconciliation algorithm that minimizes DOM manipulations, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
* **Rich Widget Library:** Includes a set of pre-built, Material Design-inspired widgets like `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `TextField`, `ListView`, `Dialog`, and more.
* **Themed and Customizable:** Widgets are styled using a shared, dynamic CSS system. Easily create and apply themes, including custom scrollbars powered by SimpleBar.js.
* **Hot Reloading:** The architecture is designed to support hot reloading for a rapid development cycle.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* PySide6 (`pip install pyside6`)

### Installation

Currently, PyThra is under active development. To use it, you can install it using pip or clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
# Install pythra and its prerequisites
pip install pythra

# Check pythra installation
pythra doctor

# create a pythra project
pyhtra create-project new-app

```

## 💡 Example Usage

Building an application with PyThra is simple and intuitive. Here’s a classic "Counter App" example:

```python
# lib/main.py
# import colors
from constants.colors import *

# Welcome to your new Pythra App!
from pythra import (
    Framework,
    StatefulWidget,
    State,

    Row,
    Key,
    Widget,

    Alignment,
    Colors,
    Center,
    ElevatedButton,
    SizedBox,
    MainAxisAlignment,
    CrossAxisAlignment,
    ClipPath,
    EdgeInsets,
    Icon,
    IconButton,
    Icons,
    ButtonStyle,
    TextStyle,
    Stack,
    Positioned,
    ClipBehavior,
    GradientTheme,
)


class HomePageState(State):
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0

    def incrementCounter(self):
        self.count += 1
        print("self.count: ", self.count)
        self.setState()

    def decrementCounter(self):
        self.count -= 1
        print("self.count: ", self.count)
        self.setState()

## 📜 Philosophy

PyThra is built on the idea that building desktop UIs should be as fluid and logical as building for the modern web.

* **The UI is a reflection of the state.** You don't manually show, hide, or update UI elements. You change the state, and the toolkit figures out the most efficient way to reflect those changes in the UI.
* **Composition over inheritance.** Complex UIs are built by nesting simple widgets. A `Button` isn't a complex class; it's a `Container` with padding, a `Text` child, and an event listener.
* **Developer Experience is paramount.** Features like hot reloading, a declarative API, and a single language (Python) for everything are designed to make development faster and more enjoyable.

## 🔬 Core Concepts

* **Widget:** The base class for everything you see on the screen. Widgets are lightweight, immutable "blueprints" for UI elements.
* **StatefulWidget & State:** For UI that needs to change dynamically, you use a `StatefulWidget`. Its mutable data is held in a separate `State` object. Calling `setState()` on this object is what triggers a UI rebuild.
* **`build()` method:** The core of every `State` object. It must return a `Widget` tree that describes the UI for the current state.
* **Reconciler:** The engine of the toolkit. It compares the widget tree returned by `build()` with the previous tree, generates a list of minimal changes (patches), and sends them to the web front-end to be applied to the DOM.
* **Key:** A special object that gives a widget a stable identity across rebuilds. This is crucial for preserving state in lists and for maintaining focus on elements like `TextField`.
