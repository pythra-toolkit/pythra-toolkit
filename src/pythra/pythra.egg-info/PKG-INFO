## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Declarative UI:** Describe your UI as a function of your application's state. When the state changes, PyThra intelligently updates only the necessary parts of the UI.
*   **Component-Based:** Build your application by composing small, reusable `Widget`s, just like in modern web frameworks.
*   **Python-First:** Write your entire application logic, state management, and UI structure in pure Python. No need to write HTML, CSS, or JavaScript by hand.
*   **Efficient Reconciliation:** Features a sophisticated reconciliation algorithm that minimizes DOM manipulations, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
*   **Rich Widget Library:** Includes a set of pre-built, Material Design-inspired widgets like `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `TextField`, `ListView`, `Dialog`, and more.
*   **Themed and Customizable:** Widgets are styled using a shared, dynamic CSS system. Easily create and apply themes, including custom scrollbars powered by SimpleBar.js.
*   **Hot Reloading:** The architecture is designed to support hot reloading for a rapid development cycle.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   PySide6 (`pip install pyside6`)

### Installation

Currently, PyThra is under active development. To use it, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/itsredx/pythra-0.0.1.git
cd pythra

# 2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# 3. Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## 💡 Example Usage

Building an application with PyThra is simple and intuitive. Here’s a classic "Counter App" example:

```python
# main.py
# import colors
from constants.colors import *

# Welcome to your new Pythra App!

    def incrementCounter(self):
        self.count += 1
        print("self.count: ", self.count)
        self.setState()

    def decrementCounter(self):
        self.count -= 1
        print("self.count: ", self.count)

## 📜 Philosophy

PyThra is built on the idea that building desktop UIs should be as fluid and logical as building for the modern web.

*   **The UI is a reflection of the state.** You don't manually show, hide, or update UI elements. You change the state, and the toolkit figures out the most efficient way to reflect those changes in the UI.
*   **Composition over inheritance.** Complex UIs are built by nesting simple widgets. A `Button` isn't a complex class; it's a `Container` with padding, a `Text` child, and an event listener.
*   **Developer Experience is paramount.** Features like hot reloading, a declarative API, and a single language (Python) for everything are designed to make development faster and more enjoyable.

## 🔬 Core Concepts

*   **Widget:** The base class for everything you see on the screen. Widgets are lightweight, immutable "blueprints" for UI elements.
*   **StatefulWidget & State:** For UI that needs to change dynamically, you use a `StatefulWidget`. Its mutable data is held in a separate `State` object. Calling `setState()` on this object is what triggers a UI rebuild.
*   **`build()` method:** The core of every `State` object. It must return a `Widget` tree that describes the UI for the current state.
*   **Reconciler:** The engine of the toolkit. It compares the widget tree returned by `build()` with the previous tree, generates a list of minimal changes (patches), and sends them to the web front-end to be applied to the DOM.
*   **Key:** A special object that gives a widget a stable identity across rebuilds. This is crucial for preserving state in lists and for maintaining focus on elements like `TextField`.
